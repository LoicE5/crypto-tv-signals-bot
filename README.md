# Crypto tv signal bot

This software uses Puppeteer, a web scraper for Node.js, to get the signal sent by [TradingView’s Technical Analysis Widget](https://www.tradingview.com/widget/technical-analysis/) for Cryptocurrencies.

You can use it, as of now, for three actions :

- Printing in the console the current price of a pair (*the default source of the price is Binance*) alongside the signal given by TradingView
- Creating a JSON file and writing on it :
    - The signal sent for a given pair
    - The current price of that pair
    - The UNIX time of the calculation
    - The given pair
    - The given interval
- Analyzing the estimated profit from a JSON file generated by the above method, based on the following strategy :
    - If the signal is “STRONG BUY”, we long the pair x2
    - If the signal is “BUY”, we long the pair x1
    - If the signal is “NEUTRAL”, we exit the market
    - If the signal is “SELL”, we short the pair x1
    - If the signal is “STRONG SELL”, we short the pair x2
    
    This method can also be used calculating the invert strategy (shorting x2 if “STRONG BUY” and so on).
    

# How to run

First, install the `node_modules`

```bash
npm install
```

Then, compile the TypeScript code (it will automatically create a build folder) :

```bash
tsc
```

Finally, you can run three different actions listed above as follows :

1. To log the signal and the price of a given pair, run :
    
    ```bash
    node build simulate --pair=BTCUSDT --interval=1m
    ```
    
2. To write the simulation data in a JSON file, run :
    
    ```bash
    node build write --pair=BTCUSDT --interval=1m --delay=10
    ```
    
3. To analyze the estimated profit from a JSON file, run :
    
    ```bash
    node build analyze --path=../output/file.jsonc --inverted=false
    ```

## Run in real time

Alternatively, if you are developing new features on this project aiming for a pull request (much appreciated), you can open two different terminals at the root of its directory and run :

```bash
tsc -w # Automatically compile TypeScript into JavaScript on file save
```

```bash
nodemon build # Enter your CLI arguments right here (nodemon will execute node and automatically refresh the execution on file change)
```

If you don’t have nodemon installed on your computer, you can use :

```bash
npm install -g nodemon # Installing nodemon globally (-g) is much recommended knowing that is is only used for development purposes, never on production
```
